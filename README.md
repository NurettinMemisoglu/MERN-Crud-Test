MERN-Cruid-Test

This is my first fullstack MERN project. The project supports basic 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', and 'DELETE' operations. On the HomePage, products from a MongoDB database are displayed, and each product card includes options to update or delete the product. On the CreatePage, new items can be added. I used Vite with React for the frontend, the Node.js Express framework for the backend, MongoDB as the database, and Chakra UI 3.0.0 for frontend components.
